#  School Management System

Developed as part of a group project during my 2nd year, 1st semester, this system streamlines school administration by managing student records, class schedules, and academic data. My primary contribution was designing and implementing the Student Registration module, enabling efficient CRUD operations and an intuitive search feature for locating students by name. This module enhances accessibility and simplifies data management, ensuring a seamless experience for administrators.
